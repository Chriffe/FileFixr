# FileFixr

This is an application written in Python that helps you santize file and directory names, removing invalid characters. It is useful for example when preparing a large number of files and directories before uploading it to OneDrive or SharePoint.

The application removes trailing and leading spaces and invalid characters by using a list of allowed characters. The reason for this is that there are to many characters to keep track of that can cause problems. For now the application only allows characters commonly used in Europe.

FileFixr has a simple GUI that makes it easy to use. **BEWARE: USING THE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR OWN RISK!** If you do not know what you are doing, you can cause som serious trouble on your computer.

The application was co-written by ChatGPT 4, since I am not a programmer. The language was chosen by me since I can read and modify Python fairly easy.
